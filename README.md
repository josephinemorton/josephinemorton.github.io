This is my first website :tada:

This is my story of learning skills and tools that I can use in my job to make my life easier. It is all about *automating* tasks to more efficeintly use time, I don't want to do the **boring and mindless** tasks.

My brain is starting to *melt* :icecream: :snowman: but that may have something to do with it being **Friday**.
